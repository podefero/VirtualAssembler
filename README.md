To build tests and main program run:
./build.sh

This will create a build folder which contains output file for main program named main_prog in build/
and a output file for test in build/tests named tests

To run main_prog run these commands:
cd build
./main_prog <filePath>

To run tests (assuming you are in build folder)
cd tests
./tests
